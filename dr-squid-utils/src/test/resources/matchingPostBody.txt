This is a post body
It will contain commands in it...
Usually telling a service to do something
So it could be JSON...

{
    "command": {
        "type": "SomeRequest",
        "data": {
            "key": "value"
        }
    }
}

... or really it could be anything, even XML, or just plain text!
But it's probably JSON.
In any of these cases, we want to match on a certain keyword
In fact, this should match based on the word right there ^
